## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../photo.jpg">

Hi! I am the eResearch Analyst employed by Intersect Australia, based at the University of New England, Armidale, NSW. I have been in this role for two years and based at UNE for nine years. I moved to Armidale from Melbourne to undertake a PhD in 2010 in the inter-disciplinary field of peace and conflict studies. My PhD focused on the [socio-cultural impacts of democratisation in Timor-Leste](https://osf.io/fmsnh/). 

My academic research training is in Sociology, Political Science and International Relations, with a particular focus on Peace and Conflict Studies. Whilst my research background is somewhat unusual for my current role as an eResearch Analyst, I bring a number of years of academic and industry research and engagement experience. 

Since taking on this role a couple of years ago, I have been learning computational methods and languages including R, SQL, and  Python. I am particularly interested in the possibilities that advanced computational techniques and database solutions bring to the Arts and Humanities research areas in the form of natural language processing, and as such have began a Masters of Data Science.
