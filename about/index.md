## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../photo.jpg">

Hi! I am the eResearch Analyst employed by Intersect Australia, based at the University of New England, Armidale. I have been in this role for two years and based at UNE for 9 years. I moved here from Melbourne to undertake a PhD in 2010. 

My academic research training is in Sociology, Political Science and International Relations, with a particular focus on Peace and Conflict Studies. Whilst my research background is somewhat unusual for my role as an eResearch Analyst, I bring a number of years of academic and industry research experience. 

Since taking on this role a couple of years ago, I have been learning computational methods and languages including R and SQL, and recently Python as well. I am particularly interested in the possibilities that advanced computational techniques and database solutions bring to the Arts and Humanities research areas by way of natural language processing and semantic analysis, and as such have began a Masters of Data Science.
