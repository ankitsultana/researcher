# Geolocating Russian Anti-Ship Missiles in Occupied Crimea | 29 November 2018

_With thanks to Sector035, MCantow, and Samir._

On 27 November 2018, Russian state media outlets published three clips of GRAU 3K60 “Bal” launchers, each carrying eight [X-35 anti-ship missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-35), and [a Monolit-B radar system](http://www.deagel.com/Tactical-Vehicles/Monolit-B_a003643001.aspx) moving in convoy down a foggy rural road, allegedly on the road from Sevastopol to Kerch.

The first video was posted to RT’s Twitter account at 14:48 UTC:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian ‘Bal’ coastal defense systems relocated near <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kerch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Kerch</a> after standoff with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ukraine</a> (EXCLUSIVE) <a href="https://t.co/FNo5RnjPhj">pic.twitter.com/FNo5RnjPhj</a></p>&mdash; RT (@RT_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/1067475304007036930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

This footage was subsequently [uploaded to RT’s Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvXbhPe0Gtk).

A second video appeared on YouTube at 15:38 UTC by 15 минут, an account operated by Ukrainian broadcaster ATR, but, from the watermark, the video source was an RT broadcast.

A third video, containing the footage from the first two clips cut together, was uploaded to RT’s Youtube channel at 16:10 UTC.

The best clue was the mural on the retaining wall behind the parked transporter-launchers. On the leftmost edge of the mural, there is a St. George ribbon emerging from behind a red shape:

The same mural, commemorating Sevastopol’s 225th anniversary, appears on Yandex Street View imagery on Highway P27 at 33.654451 44.606703.

The rest of the footage takes place along a single stretch of road beginning at a cut in the hillside.
