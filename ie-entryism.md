# Identity Evropa's Radicalization and Recruitment Tactics | 14 March 2019

_No bloody thanks at all to Medium._

When the [Identity Evropa Discord leaks](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/server/34) dropped at Unicorn Riot last week, I went straight for [the social media coordinator](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/view/1364518?q=#msg), expecting him to suffer, as do most social media coordinators, from the Awlaki Dilemma, and I was not disappointed.

Identity Evropa's social media coordinator "Brunswick" is one Michael Vespa, formerly of Raritan Valley Community College, now at Rutgers.  He is a member of the Rutgers College Republicans.  The leaked transcripts reveal that IE had a coordinated plan to join College Republicans clubs to turn those organizations towards full-blown white nationalism.  It seems likely they will continue this project as the American Identity Movement.

***

Michael Vespa was identifiable because he was not adequately concerned with infiltrators in the server.  He reveals his real name himself, in [a discussion from 9 November 2017](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/view/1396913?q=#msg) about a dispute he's having with the administration at the community college he attends (reformatted for clarity):

>The first pastebin explains how my 1st amendment rights and freedom of speech has been denied by my college who is threatening to expel me  
>As that is going on I was a member of my college's Student Government Association which chose to unconstitutionally kick me out to appease The Office of Multicultural Affairs  
>If any of you guys want to shoot an email to the officers listed in the 2nd pastebin it can affect their views. I recommend not being edgy or confrontational, they will listen to people who are concerned or worried

>concerning what to say would be just express concern that Michael Vespa is being removed from SGA, that its unneccesary, he doesn't deserve it, he dindu nuttin, is that legal?

>Hey @Brunswick I want to help and get those e-mails sent. I'm new to IE, so I have not been following what's been happening to you. Your school is Raritan Valley CC... correct?

>Brunswick  
>2017-11-09 23:04:35  
>Yea  

The Pastebins link to Vespa's account of his dispute with the administration.  I haven't attempted to verify it, since I am not interested in Vespa's personal life, merely in where and how his organization operates.  The exchange indicates, in no particular order, that:
  * IE's leadership believes that they are adequately vetting members.
  * Some members are confident enough in IE vetting to use their real names as their server handles.
  * IE is invested in shielding its members from the social consequences of their actions.

We don't know how Unicorn Riot got the transcripts, but it seems more likely that it was through weaknesses in IE's vetting process than through an intrusion.

A search for "Michael Vespa Raritan Valley Community College" will not bring up any further details of the incident, but it does reveal [an article in the college paper about Vespa's SGA campaign](http://www.rvcctherecord.com/2017/03/21/sga-election-results/) and [another about the College Republicans club he founded](http://www.rvcctherecord.com/2018/02/19/the-young-republicans-club-rvccs-first-political-club/).

Vespa founded the RVCC College Republicans as part of IE's effort to target College Republican organizations with their entryist tactics.  Vespa appears to be involved both as a local operative, and nationally in his capacity as social media coordinator.  A search for "College Republicans" in the transcripts turns up several conversations about this project, [including one reproduced below](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/view/1393950?q=#msg), which describes an IE Discord server disguised as a forum for young Republicans.

Vespa has since [transferred to Rutgers](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/view/1626784?q=rutgers#msg), where he has once again [insinuated himself amongst the College Republicans](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/view/1549175?q=college+republicans#msg).

>Brunswick  
>2018-12-17 23:37:45  
>I'm looking forward to another semester of college republicans  
>We have a few guys at Rutgers already and i'll likely become an officer in the club next semester

The extent of his activism with the College Republicans is unclear.  [An op-ed by a Michael Vespa](http://www.dailytargum.com/article/2019/03/solution-to-poverty-is-in-individual-acts) appears on the Daily Targum: it holds up charity and volunteerism as alternatives to state welfare, and makes no mention of race.  The Michael Vespa of the op-ed is a junior studying political science, which fits with Brunswick's transfer date and his major as listed in the RVCC graduation in 2018.  If the Michael Vespa of the op-ed is indeed Brunswick, the op-ed would appear to be another example of IE's Republican-focused entryist tactics.
