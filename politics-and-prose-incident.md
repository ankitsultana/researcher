The first clue to their identities was the AIM sticker on the bullhorn:

The American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa) is a white nationalist organization that seeks to mainstream fascism by taking over the American conservative movement from the inside.  Thanks to the [Identify Evropa project](https://identifyevropa.org/) and [Panic! In The Discord's masterlist](https://pad.riseup.net/p/r.f6c36916ae98317d351f6f1d817799fb) of known AIM/IE activists, all but three of the culprits were easy to identify.

The fascist with the bullhorn is Patrick Casey, AIM/IE's leader.  He replaced Elliot Klein in 2018.  He lives in Northern Virginia.  Further information at [Identify Evropa](https://identifyevropa.org/patrick-casey-executive-director/).

The second fascist is unidentified.

The third fascist is David Fanelli of Pennsylvania.  He works at Boeing.  Perhaps Boeing wants to do something about this.  Perhaps call their Ethics Line at 1-888-970-7171.

The fifth fascist is Jonathan Gould of Washington.  He is a member of the US Army, and is likely one of the 11 military personnel under investigation in the aftermath of the Unicorn Riot leaks.

The sixth fascist is Jacalyn Thomas of Ohio. She has a charming habit of getting into fights at Richard Spencer events.  She appears with Peter Diezel in the photo taken at the University of Illinois, wearing the same coat.  Their exact relationship is unknown.  Further information at [Panic!
