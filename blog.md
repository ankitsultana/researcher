## Some technical and random musings

1. [Aerial Robotics Selection Task 1](blog/arl-t1) I descrive the first task that I received as part of the process of joining the lab. Some tips/tricks about openCV, unexpected appearances of ML algorithms and basic path planning covered.

2. [K-Balanced Teams](blog/k-bal) A very interesting DP problem that I found on codeforces. Might be easy for DP pros but eh. I also talk about the basics of dynamic programming and the general idea.

Shoot me an email, if you got anything to add/discuss!
