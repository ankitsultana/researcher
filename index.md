## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="QUT Day3 HR-39.jpg">

PhD student with a demonstrated history of working in various multi-disciplinary projects within the field of robotics. I am particularly interested in methods and techniques that can allow reinforcement learning agents to effectively leverage prior knowledge for sample efficient training and safe, real-world deployment of robotic systems.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on methods which combine classicalrobotic control strategies with deep reinforcement learning to improve the sample efficiency of these algorithms during trainingwhile allowing the system to improve beyond the abilities of the base controller. As we strive to solve real-world problems usingrobots acting in the real world, it is imperative that we can effectively leverage the large body of classical research which alreadysolves parts of the tasks and bootstrap the RL learning process to quickly build up from this base as opposed to learning fromscratch. I am additionally interested in exploring ways in which we can ensure the safety and robustness of these trained systemswhen acting in the real world
