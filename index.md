## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! I am the eResearch Analyst employed by Intersect Australia, based at the University of New England, Armidale, NSW. I have been in this role for two years and based at UNE for nine years. I moved to Armidale from Melbourne to undertake a PhD in 2010 in the inter-disciplinary field of peace and conflict studies. My PhD focused on the [socio-cultural impacts of democratisation in Timor-Leste](https://osf.io/fmsnh/).

## Current position
### eResearch Analyst, Intersect Australia
*May 2016-ongoing*

I am currently based at UNE in this role, reporting to the Deputy Vice Chancellor - Research (DVCR), Prof. Heiko Daniel. Whilst based in the Research Services Directorate, to carry out this role effectively, there is a need to work collaboratively with the University Library and the IT Directorate, as well as the faculties. Through these relationships I have been an active member of a number of UNE's grant-funded research projects, strategic university-wide eResearch initiatives, and researcher training events. I have included a selection below:

#### Strategic initiatives
* Since August 2016 I have chaired the University's [eResearch Committee](http://www.une.edu.au/research/digital-research-support/eresearch-committee), a committee sponsored by the DVCR, since August 2016, established to advance the university's eResearch services. In my time as chair, I have led the investigation of various university eResearch capabilities; overseen the committee's restructure and renewal; and reported to the University Research Committee and the DVCR as required.
* Initiating and leading a year-long, university-wide Research Data Management project. This project functioned to build awareness amongst researchers, positively affect cultural change, streamline corporate workflows, advocate for further investment into infrastructure capabilities, and establish and maintain weekly reports on UNE researchers' usage of the institutional cloud storage platform, [Cloud.UNE](https://cloud.une.edu.au). The [latest report](http://rpubs.com/ptobias2/397939) indicates how successful this project has been in increasing researchers' usage of Cloud.UNE.
* Undertaking a [web-scraping and text analysis project](https://github.com/paddytobias/eResearchImpactEngagement) to support UNE's preparation for the Research Engagement and Impact assessment, using 2014 submissions to the UK REF Impact assessment.  

#### Research projects
* Providing eResearch support to an ARC Discovery Project in digital musicology led by Dr Jason Stoessel since 2016. I also supported the successful application for a successive ARC Discovery grant awarded to Dr Stoessel and his colleague, Dr Denis Collins (UQ). My work in this project has involved leading the ETL of ~5,000 data records from a FileMaker Pro database into an open source online database repository called Muscat using database techniques; scripting bug fixes in Python and SQL; and supporting a constructive relationship between Dr Stoessel and Intersect's Engineering team. A staging version of the [Canonic Techniques website](https://canons-staging.intersect.org.au/catalog) is live. 
* In 2016-17, I initiated and lead the [Ngan'gi Language Collection Enhancement](https://projects.ands.org.au/id/CEP13) project for A/Prof. Nick Reid, funded by the Australian National Data Service. This including scoping realistic web-based solutions for A/Prof Reid's requirements; managing the execution of the project from start to finish; and coordinating user acceptance testing, content migration and training. A/Prof Reid and I [presented the project](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/2017/08/improving-the-online-profile-of-the-ngangi-language-collection/) at the 2017 eResearch Australasia conference.

#### Education & Training
* I currently coordinate Intersect's training program at UNE, delivering many of the programming, data science and data management courses myself with the help of two on-campus trainers. I manage two on-campus trainers and between the three of us, we deliver the only research training program at UNE. 
* Over the past two years I have worked to improve the experience of participants inside and outside of the courses, through building up a network of interested researchers and systematically notifying them when courses become available. I have found that this has created a community atmosphere to the training, which has facilitated peer-to-peer learning. 
* Earlier this year I also completed the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) accreditation. I am currently developing new courseware for [teaching the survey tool, Qualtrics](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/surveys-with-qualtrics), with input from the Sydney-based Qualtrics office, as well as [research software management](https://github.com/paddytobias/research-software-management). 
* I regularly present to researchers and staff on data and software management techniques, eResearch capabilities, and help researchers in their projects through consultation and advice. 
* I currently sit on the organising committee for [Sydney ResBaz (3-5 July, 2018)](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/sydney/). The event was held at Macquarie University and was a huge success. I was lead instructor for the [*Introductory R* stream](https://paddytobias.github.io/2018-07-03-resbaz-syd-intro-r/), coordinating three other trainers as well. 

## Other experience
* Corporate Communications Officer (2015-2016), *UNE*
In this position I reported to the Office of the Vice Chancellor and spearheaded the Research Communications Strategy for the university. 
* Casual academic lecturer and tutor (2011-2015), *UNE*
I have held various short-term academic contracts in Sociology, Political Science and International Relations, Peace anf Conflict Studies and Education. 
* Research Fellow (2014), *Queen's University* (Belfast)
* Lead consultant (2013), Women’s Empowerment and Access to Justice project in Timor-Leste for *Search for Common Ground* (Washington)
