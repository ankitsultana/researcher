## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="archit.png">

Hi! I am Archit, a freshman at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur currently completing a BS+MS in Mathematics and Computing. I've had stints with competetive programming and software development.  Currently, I'm a software team member at Aerial Robotics Lab, Kharagpur and an independent researcher into NLP, Reinforcement Learning and Image Processing.

Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* Getting a quadcopter to fly using NEAT networks[1]. NEAT is a special kind of genetic algorithm which evolves neural networks with extremely unconventional designs and find the optimal weights at the same time. At ARL, I'm currently trying to get quadcopters to hold position and change heights with unprecedented stability using reinforcement learning.

* Figuring out the gender of Hindi words using Convolutional Neural Networks! This is being done in collaboration with Samriddhi Sinha. An online demo of the network is [here](sangita-demo.html). A publication is expected soon.

* Trying to measure the convergence of a chaotic sequence. The intended goal is to find suitable learning rates for gradient descent automatically and create a new class of optimizers.

## Past

Coming soon!

## Publications
