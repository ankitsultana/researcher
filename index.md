## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="archit.jpg">

Hi! I am Archit, a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur currently completing a BS+MS in Mathematics and Computing. I've had stints with competetive programming and software development.  Currently, I'm a perception team member at Aerial Robotics Lab, Kharagpur and an independent researcher into NLP, Reinforcement Learning and Image Processing.

Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* Working on a new architecture for object localization and detection in images using recurrent deep learning models with attention module. 

* Trying to measure the convergence of a chaotic sequence. The intended goal is to find suitable learning rates for gradient descent automatically and create a new class of optimizers. Based on Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence and Logistic Distribution. 

* Struggling with my NLP Course term project on Named Entity Recognition in Bio Medical Corpora. 

* Working on an app using Node.JS, Express and Ionic to automatically find riders for point to point shared rides. Useful in my university as the nearest major airport is 130KM away. The biggest challenge is solving the combinatorial optimization problem of which riders to pool with as users have friend preference but want to wait as little as possible. Based on ideas rooted in a minimum spanning tree.

* You can find me on codeforces as [architrungta120](https://codeforces.com/profile/architrungta120). I've recently started dipping my toes in competetive programming again.

## Past

* Won 1st prize at indoor IMAV 2019, a micro aerial vehicle competition. I was involved in the finite state machine and computer vision modules. Had to write a new module that used temporary log files while our contest time was running as the old one failed due to a race condition.

* Made a glove with Shreyansh Darshan that uses IMU sensor to map the entire hand with all its motions. As a sample use, created neural networks to learn sign language symbols and interpret. The project was coded in C++ and Python.  [Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/Rl1C584UrW0).

* Had a run with PoW cryptocurrency miners. Wrote the first [GPU miner for Keccak PoW](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453573.0). Collaborated with [Dr. Dave Anderson](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/) from CMU to port his Linux CUDA miner for Momentum to Windows. Also wrote one of the first two Monero mining pools. 

* Wrote a 3D perspetive projector from scratch using C++ and Windows API as highschool senior year CS project. 

* Developed some of the most popular mods for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 back in 8th grade. Including [External RCON](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-BigBrotherBot-External-Rcon-0-5-Chat-viewer-0-2-beta.html) and [MapEdit](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-MapEdit-for-MW3-1-4.html).

* Attended the Indian Informatics Olympiad Training Camp in 2017 and 2018. First participant from my state ever and the youngest one at 'TC 2017. 

## Future

* ICPC? 

* Graduate?

* More research?

* ...

## Random

* Whiteboards help me think better. The bigger, the better. 

* I love going out for trips and exploring different cultures/environments!

* Indian Food > All other cuisines. Please change my mind. 

* airbnb > hotels. Can't change my mind.

* Anime > everything else. 

* Coldplay is <3 

## Publications

Hopefully coming soon!
