## Hi

My name is Brendan. I do things on computer, and occassionally I do other things. I hope to post more here soon.

This page is based off a template from [bk2dcradle on Github](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/researcher).

## My career

I currently work at [Genomics England](http://genomicsengland.com), or you can see my history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-mckitrick-6b670820/).

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mckitrick) but I don't say much.
