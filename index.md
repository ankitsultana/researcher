## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="archit.png">

Hi! I am Archit, a freshman at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur currently completing a BS+MS in Mathematics and Computing. I've had stints with competetive programming and software development.  Currently, I'm a software team member at Aerial Robotics Lab, Kharagpur and an independent researcher into NLP, Reinforcement Learning and Image Processing.

Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* Getting a quadcopter to fly using NEAT networks. NEAT is a special kind of genetic algorithm which evolves neural networks with extremely unconventional designs and find the optimal weights at the same time. At ARL, I'm currently trying to get quadcopters to hold position and change heights with unprecedented stability using reinforcement learning.

* Figuring out the gender of Hindi words using Convolutional Neural Networks! This is being done in collaboration with [Samriddhi Sinha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samriddhisinha/). An online demo of the network is [here](sangita-demo.html). Coded in Python using Keras and TensorFlow. A publication is expected soon.

* Trying to measure the convergence of a chaotic sequence. The intended goal is to find suitable learning rates for gradient descent automatically and create a new class of optimizers. Based on Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence and Logistic Distribution. 

* You can find me on codeforces as [architrungta120](https://codeforces.com/profile/architrungta120). I've recently started dipping my toes in competetive programming again.

## Past

* Made a glove that uses IMU sensor to map the entire hand with all its motions. As a sample use, created neural networks to learn sign language symbols and interpret. The p roject was coded in C++ and Python.  [Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/Rl1C584UrW0).

* Had a stint with PoW cryptocurrency miners. Wrote the first [GPU miner for Keccak PoW](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453573.0). Collaborated with [Dr. Dave Anderson](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/) from CMU to port his Linux CUDA miner for Momentum to Windows. Also wrote one of the first two Monero mining pools. 

* Wrote a 3D perspetive projector from scratch using C++ and Windows API as highschool senior year CS project. 

* Developed some of the most popular mods for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 back in 8th grade. Including [External RCON](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-BigBrotherBot-External-Rcon-0-5-Chat-viewer-0-2-beta.html) and [MapEdit](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-MapEdit-for-MW3-1-4.html).

* Attended the Indian Informatics Olympiad Training Camp in 2017 and 2018. First participant from my state ever and the youngest one at 'TC 2017. 

## Future

* ICPC? 

* Graduate?

* More research?

* ...

## Random

* Whiteboards help me think better. The bigger, the better. 

* I love going out for trips and exploring different cultures/environments!

* Indian Food > All other cuisines. Please change my mind. 

* airbnb > hotels. Can't change my mind.

* Anime > everything else. 

* Coldplay is <3 

## Publications

Hopefully coming soon!
